1CABF400.dat from game cia (not update) also contains item descriptions and is better extracted
with extract instead of extract-old (but repacking is still extremly faulty with that command)
=> probably irrelevant since updated dat file doesn't contain descriptions and they are now
in an extra archvie


These item names need to be checked again:
- Evil Tail (tail of boss in stage 15)
- Chestnuts
- Evil Arms
- Stingray Boots
- Block Sandals (+Black Stone +Light Stone referring to chinese star constellation?)


the following dat files don't repack properly:
- 22720f3800
- 34574800 - Companion Skills
- d84acc00

notes:
try repack-v2
