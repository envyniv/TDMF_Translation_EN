* TODO [#A] Rewrite guide

  This document comprises a brief look into the necessary steps to approach translation
  within this project.

  This guide is meant to teach anyone interested in translating "The Denpa Men FREE" (hereby referred to as TDMF/DPMF interchangably) - which
  never got an english release - regardless of their knowledge of "Nintendo 3DS-game-asset-editing" or general IT skills.

  It is however, recommended to have basic knowledge on the usage of Windows Explorer.

  **WARNING**: _No liability is assumed! Be careful when following this guide to not cause any unwanted damage to your data!_

  *This is a guide oriented at Windows users, who are usually not familiar with
  the command prompt or other unconventional operations.*

  *Screenshots provided may not always be in english. Some imagination is required.*

** Preparation and Basics

*** Required software

  **ATTENTION**: No liability is assumed for any damage caused.

  Make sure to download the latest release by clicking on the '.exe' download in the page.

  We'll also be using
  - TDMF with the latest update installed (We can't provide you with it, you're on your own)
  - [Citra Nightly](https://citra-emu.org)
  - A text editor (We highly recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/))

  Additionally, you could need
  - A Hex Editor (we recommend [Wxmedit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxmedit/))

*** TODO Basics of the Command Prompt (~cmd~)

  In order to proceed, you first have to know of the basics on "Command Prompt" usage.
  This program, launched by looking up 'cmd' in the start menu (or alternatively typing it in the popup from hitting the Win+R keybind)

**** CD
  a core command of the ~cmd~ experience is ~cd~, also known as ~CHDIR~.
  It allows you to navigate in your system's folders, see it as
