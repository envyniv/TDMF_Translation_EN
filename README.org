/Collaboration project to tranlsate "電波人間のRPG Free" into English./

/This project contains an overview of fully translated, partly translated and yet to be translated text files. Keep in mind that this project will expand and does not provide all existing text files as of now./

/If you want to apply the patch on Citra or a homebrewed Nintendo 3ds console, download the [[./releases][zip]]. Check online tutorials or the text document inside the zip folder about LayeredFS on how to apply it./

Add a new speech bubble: <1"\u0000>\n  (for stage text etc.)

* Tasks
** Unpacking
*** TODO [#A] Decompress ~.zip~
*** TODO [#A] Decompress ~.arc~
** Repacking
*** TODO [#A] Repack ~.arc~
We need a way to identify arc files, we could save a file list inside the identifying folder as =.arc=
** TODO [#A] Fix github workflow
** TODO [#B] version/commit in translation files
*** FE74000A/7495BC00
- ["text_info"][6]
- ["text_info"][58]

#+begin_example
$ jq '.text_info.[6], .text_info.[58]' "StartOptions 7495BC00.json"
#+end_example
** TODO [#C] replace xcf icon with svg
- I'm working on vectorifying tropic's assets, we can use those to recreate the denpa man
- The logo has been recreated by pogam, if he gives me the svg i can use his "FREE"
** DONE [#A] include template app json for unistore
** TODO [#A] ship as .ips
** TODO [#C] ship as update/game .cia
*** TODO [#B] patch manual to include credits of translation
*** TODO [#A] patch banner
can't be patched with update
*** TODO [#A] patch SMDH
I expect this also cannot be patched with an update
We should only change the name - there's no reason for changing the icon
*** TODO [#A] 


** TODO [#C] add translation credits after campaign end?
not as dialogue, more like a conventional credits scene, a la dpm2/3; perhaps that would be the scope of a "fan-update"-like project
